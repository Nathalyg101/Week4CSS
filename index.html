            <h2>Who I am as a Designer</h2>
            <p>Design is about imagining, exploring, creative thinking, and being able to excute those ideas.
                The aspect I enjoy about design, is not being confined to a certain measurment of it. I don't 
                solely have to work in a specific area for the rest of my life but instead can enjoy a little 
                bit of everything because we work as a team to move foward in the world of design.

            <h2>Who I am as a Person</h2>
            <p>I enjoy very few things, but those few things are what I like to keep close to my heart. I enjoy 
                colllecting little trinkets like funko pops, music albums, and plushies. I also love to walk 
                around NYC, it's one of the few things I can do freely without needing to waste money, I can go 
                to open spaces and take a breath of fresh air and feel as all my stresses lift off my shoulders.
                While doodling in my free time, I also enjoy watching movies like Avatar, Avengers Endgame, and
                other fantasy or romance movies.

            <h2>Concentrations</h2>
            <p>In my area of study; communications design, I focus on branding, packaging, and 
                advertising design. Although I thoroughly enjoy some of the other fields, I really zero in on 
                these three areas, as I feel myself lose track of time and enjoy the process of creating. I also 
                have a background in illustration as I've been illustrating for about 5-6 years now, and love to 
                implement some illustrations in my designs. I want to be able to bring both my skills and my way of thinking
                to the next level and continue to grow as an individual.
